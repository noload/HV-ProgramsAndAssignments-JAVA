# Array Manipulation:

# Given an array of integers, write a Python function to find the maximum subarray sum (the sum of a contiguous subarray) using the Kadane's algorithm. Provide the start and end indices of the subarray as well.
# Array Sorting:

# Implement a Python function to sort an array of integers using the quicksort algorithm. Include both the recursive and iterative versions of the algorithm.
# Linked List Intersection:

# Write a Python function that finds the intersection point of two singly linked lists. If the lists do not intersect, return None. Optimize for time and space complexity.
# Circular Linked List:

# Create a Python class for a circular linked list and include methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal. Demonstrate how to add elements to and remove elements from a circular linked list.
# Array Rotation:

# Given an array of integers, write a Python function to rotate the array to the right by a given number of positions. Optimize the algorithm to have a time complexity of O(n).
# Linked List Palindrome:

# Implement a Python function to determine if a singly linked list is a palindrome. You can't use additional data structures; solve it in O(n) time and O(1) space.
